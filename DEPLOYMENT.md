## üöÄ GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

Your app has been built and deployed. To make it visible at `https://infinity-009.github.io/coupondel/`, follow these steps:

### 1. **Push Code to GitHub Repository**
```bash
# From the root coupondel directory
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment of Coupondel app"
git push -u origin master
```

### 2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/infinity-009/coupondel`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose **Branch**: `gh-pages`
6. Choose **Folder**: `/ (root)`
7. Click **Save**

### 3. **Wait for Deployment**
- GitHub Pages takes 5-10 minutes to deploy
- You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready
- Visit: `https://infinity-009.github.io/coupondel/`

### 4. **Troubleshooting**
If the site shows 404:
- Ensure the repository `infinity-009/coupondel` exists and is public
- Check that the `gh-pages` branch was created (should be automatic)
- Wait a few more minutes for GitHub's CDN to update

### 5. **Re-deploy Changes**
To deploy updates:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run deploy -- --repo=https://github.com/infinity-009/coupondel.git
```
